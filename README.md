In this project, explore movie data of popular streaming platforms and build a recommendation system.





Due to the new culture of Binge-watching TV Shows and Movies, users are consuming content at a fast pace with available services like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. Some of these new platforms, such as Hulu and YouTube TV, also offer live streaming of events like Sports, live concerts/tours, and news channels. Live streaming is still not adopted by some of the streaming platforms, such as Netflix.
